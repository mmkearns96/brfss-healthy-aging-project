Title: Predicting Self-Rated Health in Seniors: Analysis of the 2015 BRFSS Survey With Machine Learning Techniques
Author: Madeleine May Kearns, BSc, MA

Background: Research has consistently shown that socioeconomic status, physical activity, smoking, diet, and alcohol 
consumption have a significant effect on health in older individuals. However, most of the current literature has evaluated 
the unique effect of isolated attributes. Currently, there are only a few studies assessing the cumulative effects 
of demographic characteristics and lifestyle behaviours on self-reported health in seniors. 

Objective: This project uses the 2015 BRFSS survey to answer the following research questions: 
(1) what demographic characteristics are associated with good health in individuals aged 60 years or older, 
(2) what lifestyle behaviours are associated with good health in individuals aged 60 years or older, and 
(3) what is the cumulative predictive power of demographic and lifestyle characteristics on good health 
in individuals aged 60 years or older? 

Methodology overview: Cross-sectional analyses will be conducted to compare demographic characteristics and lifestyle behaviours 
between seniors who reported good and poor general health in the survey. For predictive modeling, classification approaches will be 
used to assess the cumulative predictive power of demographic and lifestyle characteristics on health in individuals aged 60 years 
or older. The best-performing model will be hyper-optimized and feature importance will be assessed to determine the variables 
that most strongly predict health in older individuals.
